# Flow Reactor Analysis

This section includes two notebooks that work through analysis of data obtained in differential packed bed reactors. The first presents a typical textbook analysis of steady state reaction rates, and the second illustrate what startup of a packed bed will likely look like in the laboratory, where transient phenomena can make it difficult for us to determine what exactly is an appropriate definition for reaction rate and/or turnover frequency.
