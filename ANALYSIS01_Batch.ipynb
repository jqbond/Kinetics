    "This Notebook works through a textbook analysis of data obtained over heterogeneous catalysts using a batch reactor. Data presented here are simulated experimental data that are intended to highlight specific features of reactions catalyzed by solids that appear commonly in peer-reviewed literature and may obscure fundamental insights.\n",

    "## Analysis of Data obtained in a Batch Reactor\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will start the analysis as is typically presented in most undergraduate textbooks. Quite often, one sees similar analyses in peer-reviewed literature as well. It is very likely that our training would generally prompt us to approach the analysis in either or both of two ways: relatively macroscopic ***differential analysis*** or ***integral analysis***. It is less likely that we would attempt a more sophisticated ***microkinetic*** analysis at this point as we know very little about the reaction mechanims.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the different names, these methods both essentially refer to the material balance on a batch reactor. The difference between them is how we analyze the material balance. To use them, we should really first write an appropriate material balance for our batch reactor. For the moment, we will choose the one that usually sticks in most people's memories from courses in physical chemistry and reaction engineering, which is that of a constant volume, perfectly-mixed batch reactor.  Presently, I see no reason why I couldn't apply this balance since the experiment was performed in an autoclave reactor of fixed volume, and we have stated that data are obtained under conditions of kinetic control and perfect mixing. We will use the notation from Scott Fogler's *Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering* as this is one that most of us are going to be familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dC_A}{dt} = R_A$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This balance simply states that, in a perfectly mixed, constant volume batch reactor, the rate of change in the concentration of species A is equal to the intensive rate of production of species A per unit volume. To move the analysis further, we need to define the intensive production rate of species A, $R_A$ as a function of reaction rate. We do this by invoking information about reaction stoichiometry, i.e., each time the reaction occurs, it consumes one molecular or molar equivalent of species A, and it produces one equivalent of species B.  Thus, $R_A = -1r$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dC_A}{dt} = -r$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we know nothing about reaction kinetics, we have a dilemma in that we don't know a rate law that would allow us to express reaction rate as a function of the state variables of time and CA. In the absence of mechanistic insights, we would probably propose power law kinetics, which says that the rate of reaction scales with temperature (k) and species concentration raised to an unknown power, $\\alpha$, i.e., the reaction order in species A:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dC_A}{dt} = -k{C_A}^\\alpha$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we should decide whether we want to proceed with a differential or integral analysis of the data. Both have merits and disadvantages. If we do not know a reaction order, then differential analysis is convenient as it permits us to easily estimate the reaction order. The downside is that differentiation of discrete, noisy data will amplify experimental imprecision. If we do know a reaction order, then the integral analysis generally permits a more precise estimation of kinetic parameters (e.g., a rate constant).\n",
    "\n",
    "### A differential analysis of data\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don't have any information about the rate law, let's try a differential analysis. To move forward, we approximate the derivative in the material balance using finite differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dC_A}{dt} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta C_A}{\\Delta t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From our material balance, we then conclude that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r \\approx -\\frac{\\Delta C_A}{\\Delta t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this analysis provides us with a discrete set of estimated, intensive rates of reaction at multiple values of $C_A$, i.e., differential analysis of batch reactor data transforms raw $C_A$ vs. $t$ profiles into $r$ vs $C_A$ data:"

This is the gold standard for kinetic analysis! We are naturally excited to benchmark the activity of our other catalysts using this same methodology. This reaction is not known to be structure-sensitive on Pt, but we hypothesize that we can tune the performance of our Pt catalyst by changing the support from $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$ to other materials like activated $C$, $\\mathrm{\\gamma}$-$\\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$, $\\mathrm{ZrO_2}$, and $\\mathrm{TiO_2}$. We accordingly prepare a series of 3 wt% Pt catalysts on these 5 different supports, and we test their activity in this reaction using the same batch reactor described above. ***We will repeat this experiment as is commonly reported in the literature -- we will systematically change only the identity of the catalyst and keep all of our operating parameters constant.***  So, in all cases, we have the same conditions as in the original experiment:\n",

    "## Interpreting our parameter estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "We find that the barriers for each catalyst are identical, and that the entire variation in performance seems to come from different pre-exponential factors. At this point in the analysis, we would probably recall from our courses in kinetics and physical chemistry that the pre-exponential factor is generally a function of the entropy of activation for a reaction. We might then seek explanations for why the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts has a more favorable entropy of activation than the other materials. We might also be curious about why the entropy of activation is such a strong function of catalyst support. This is a logical course of analysis, but it unfortunately has all been based on a faulty assumption that the differential equation below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dC_A}{dt} = R_A$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Provides a sensible fundamental description of this batch reactor. The balance is not incorrect, per se. Our analysis does adequately reflect the volumetric reaction rate, which is clearly best on the $\\mathrm{Pt/Al_2O_3}$ catalyst. This is likely the one we would choose to use in industrial practice as it offers the highest conversion in the shortest time, which generally means less expensive capital and reactor operation. But if we are interested in a more fundamental description of the differences between the various catalysts, we need to consider variations in metal loading and/or dispersion, which leads to variations in the number of exposed active sites. This certainly would impact our observations in a batch reactor, but it is missing from the material balance that we applied for analysis. When we perform the analysis as above, variations in the active site quantity will show up in our pre-exponential. This is why, for a family of related catalysts, we commonly see similar barriers but different y-intercepts (pre-exponentials) in an Arrhenius plot. Whenever one observes identical slopes but varied y-intercepts in an Arrhenius plot, this is a telltale sign of dispersion effects, variations in loading of the active phase, or a combination of the two. It is rare to observe identical barriers (enthalpies of activation) and widely varying pre-exponential factors (entropies of activation), so when this result appears, we should ask whether we have correctly accounted for variations in the quantity of active sites. \n",
    "\n",
    "## A better analysis for heterogeneously catalyzed reactions\n",

    "If we aim to resolve fundamental differences in the materials, then we need a better description of system dynamics. It is important to remember that the material balance on a constant volume batch reactor that we invoked above is a ***special case of the general material balance***. It does not apply under all conditions, and a more useful analysis in a catalytic system requires us to general material balance, which is extensive in nature:\n",

    "Where we note that the dimensions are moles per time, and the generation term on the right hand side should be considered an extensive metric that quantifies the total rate of generation or consumption of species A within the entire batch reactor, not per unit volume of batch reactor. To get this quantity, we typically scale an intensive reaction or production rate to the size of the system. For a homogeneous reaction, it is convenient for us to define intensive reaction and production rates per unit volume of catalyst, so we would write the following definition for the extensive rate of generation, which scales a volume normalized production rate, $R_A$, to the total volume of the perfectly-mixed system:\n",

    "For a heterogeneously catalyzed reaction, extensive production rates do not scale with system volume. Rather, they scale with the quantity of catalyst inside the reactor. More specifically, they scale with the number of active sites inside of the reactor. In our experiment, we controlled the mass of catalyst (1 gram), but we did not necessarily control the number of active sites. Effectively, then, we are comparing various reactors of different sizes, which leads to a confusing analysis.  A better approach is to define the extensive production rate of species A in terms of a turnover frequency (rate per active site) and the number of active sites in the bed.\n",
