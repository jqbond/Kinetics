# Obtaining Good Kinetic Data

This site is the HTML version of various tutorials on kinetic analysis including Jupyter Notebooks presented during the NAM29 Workshop entitled "Obtaining Good Kinetic Data from Badly Behaved Reactors." This site is built from a [public repository on GitHub](https://github.com/jqbond/NAM29_KineticsWorkshop), and all source codes are available for download. The content in this site may evolve over time as tutorials continue to develop; I will continue to add updates and link to relevant chapters here.
