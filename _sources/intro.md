# Welcome to the Kinetics workshop!

I compiled workshop materials in HTML so that they are easy to view on the web without needing to actually run Jupyter or Julia.  You won't be able to interact with the code in the same way, but you should be able to use this like a mini online textbook with embedded code and figures.

The materials here work through various case studies designed to highlight non-ideal behaviors in catalytic reactors.
