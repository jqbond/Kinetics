    "### Writing a script to solve the ODE system and process the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below includes the code that solves the system of ODEs. Note that here we wrap the ODE solution in a function with various returns, which generally improves performance as the function only need be compiled once and can be solved subsequently for any parameter set by passing that parameter set to the solution function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, ODE solvers in Julia use a logical construction that is similar to ODE solvers in most high level programming languages (e.g., Matlab, Octave, Python). It relies on the use of the `ODEProblem` constructor, which builds the problem (`prob`) that is passed to the solver.  Into this constructor, one provides the name of the function containing the ODEs (`odebatch1!`), the initial values of the state variables (`u0`), the integration span for the independent variable (`tspan`), and any additiona parameters to be passed to the ODEsystem (`par`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the problem is created, a call to `solve(prob)` will solve the ODE system.  As with most ODE solvers, one has options.  Here, we are specifying the use of a Rosenbrock method (`Rosenbrock23`).  We are also including limits on the domain for all state variables through the use of a function that specifies the permissible domain of our state variables.  In this example, since our state variables are all physical quantities (mole numbers), I am specifying that all state variables must be positive at all times.  This is done by creating a domain function (`domainfunc`) that evaluates to `True` if any state variable becomes negative during the course of integration.  If that happens, the solver will return to the last step prior to encountering negative values, take a smaller step, and reevaluate.  This adds some cost to the evaluation as it will generally require taking progressively smaller steps until all state variables fall within the specified domain, but it is beneficial in cases like this one where there is a *physical* restriction on state variables (all molar quantities must be positive), but there is no *mathematical* restriction on their values becoming negative in the course of a numerical integration scheme.  The domainfunction is passed to the ODE solution through the use of the `isoutofdomain` keyword argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the solution is obtained, Julia permits interpolation of the solution at values inside of the integration span. Below, we use this to generate a simulated set of experimental data by evaluating values of $N_A$ and $N_B$ at 15 data points at specified time values. As is generally the case with most advanced numerical ODE solvers, we don't have control over the exact time steps taken by the solver; however, we are able to specify (by interpolation) the values of the solution at those time steps once the problem is solved.  This is accomplished below by passing the set of target times (`tvals`) to the raw solution structure returned by `solve(prob)`, i.e., `batchsol`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once molar quantities for A and B are obtained at desired times by interpolation, these values are used in calculating mole fractions, partial pressures, thermodynamic activities, and reaction rates at each time in `tvals`."

    "## System 2: Catalyst 2 with deactivation\n",
    "\n",
    "For this case, the catalyst is ***not*** stable. It undergoes some deactivation over the course of the reaction. We describe this deactivation by allowing the number of active sites, $N_S$ to decrease from its starting value, $N_{S0}$ over the course of reaction. This example differs from Case 1 in that the number of active sites is now time dependent, giving: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dN_j}{dt} = \\nu_j r'''N_S(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$N_A$ and $N_B$ are time dependent, so we write balances in both species as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\frac{dN_A}{dt} &= -r'''N_S(t) \\\\\n",
    "    \\frac{dN_B}{dt} &= r'''N_S(t)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the rate of reaction for Catalyst 2 is given in turnover frequency units by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} = k_2a_A$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we need a model that describes how the number of active sites is changing as a function of time.  Here, we'll assume first order deactivation; as such, the time derivative of the number of active sites, $N_S$ is proportional to the number of active sites:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dN_S}{dt} = -k_d N_S$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Subject to the initial condition that, at time = 0, the number of active sites is $N_{S0}$.  Here, the rate constant has units of inverse seconds, typical of a first order process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the balances for $N_A$ and $N_S$ are coupled. In the case of first order deactivation, an analytical solution is tractable, but the more general approach is a numerical solution. We proceed with the numerical solution since it is extensible to a much larger class of reactor modelling problems. For this case, we have the following parameters available:\n",
