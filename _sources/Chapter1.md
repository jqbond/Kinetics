# NAM 29 Workshop

This section includes the four Jupyter Notebooks discussed during the NAM29 workshop. There are two Notebooks that discuss the interpretation of Batch Reactor data, and there are two Notebooks that discuss the interpretation of flow reactor data. 

## Batch Reactors

The two Batch Reactor Notebooks work through the basics of differential and integral analysis of typical data obtained in batch reactors. The first highlights the way that dispersion effects will manifest in batch reactor data, and it discusses a better normalization for reaction rates (per unit active site) and for the extensive size of the system (total number of active sites). The second notebook highlights one example of hidden catalyst deactivation in a batch reactor and discusses how catalyst dynamics are difficult to resolve because batch data are inherently dynamic in nature.

## Flow Reactors

The first Flow Reactor Notebooks presents a textbook undergraduate example problem that covers the interpretation of kinetic data obtained in a differential packed bed reactor. As is common in undergraduate coursework, steady state reaction rates (which are inferred from effluent product flowrates in a differential packed bed) are compiled for various temperatures and feed compositions, and typical methods of analysis are applied to extract reaction orders and apparent barriers. The second notebooks presents typical startup profiles for differential packed beds. Here, one observes transient periods of operation where it is not obvious how one should define a steady state reaction rate or turnover frequency. The Notebook uses the concept of a turnover number to quantify timescales over which catalytic reactions reach steady state. We further present some strategies and insights that can be useful for defining a meaningful turnover frequency in cases where there is significant deactivation, induction, or catalyst restructuring.
