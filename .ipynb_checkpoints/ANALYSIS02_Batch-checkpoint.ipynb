    "This Notebook extends batch data analysis to compare the performanc of two different metal catalysts. We again use an approach that is common in peer-reviewed literature, and we highlight the impact of artifacts that may go unnoticed in the course of an experiment. Here, we consider a hypotehtical reaction occuring on both Pt nanoparticles and Ru nanoparticles that are dispersed on a single, high surface area support. "

    "## Let's try a totally different type of active site...\n",
    "\n",
    "In our first case study, we started with the hypothesis that support effects might give us a more active Pt catalyst. We were tempted to conclude this, but once we corrected for dispersion effects, it became clear that all of our Pt catalysts seem to have identical turnover frequencies, and that our more active materials (Pt/C and Pt/$\\gamma$-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) are only more active because they have larger quantities of accessible Pt per unit mass or volume of catalyst. This is, of course, useful to us in industrial practice as we want to minimize the physical size of our reactors, but as we start thinking about fundamental kinetics, it is important for us to focus on the activity of a single site.  From that perspective, all of the materials are identical, and we conclude that changing the support has no impact on the activity of a Pt atom on the surface of a Pt nanoparticle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll change the nature of the active site entirely--since we are looking at a metal catalyzed reaction, let's say we are going to compare our original $\\mathrm{Pt/SiO_2}$ material with a $\\mathrm{Ru/SiO_2}$ analog. For both of these metals, we have reasonable ways to count active sites, and so we go into this analysis knowing exactly how to control and correct for variations in the active surface area within the reactor. As examples, $CO$ or $H_2$ chemisorption can be used to titrate surface sites on metals. If instead we were considering acid catalysts, we might consider using something like temperature programmed desorption of propylamine to titrate Bronsted sites. This can be coupled with Pyridine FTIR to quantify the ratio of Bronsted and Lewis sites and so provide a reasonable estimate of both Bronsted and Lewis site densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empowered with these techniques, we can devise our batch reactor experiments so that we load a constant number of active sites instead of a constant mass of catalyst. In addition, this information permits us to scale results by the number of active sites so that we can determine turnover frequencies and rate constants that are more directly comparable to elementary barriers and pre-exponentials. With this information, we can better understand the behavior of two catalysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will stay with the sample example of an irreversible reaction involving only two molecules, A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A \\longrightarrow B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We perform two identical experiments for $\\mathrm{Pt/SiO_2}$ and $\\mathrm{Ru/SiO_2}$ in a perfectly mixed batch reactor. We confirm that data are obtained under isothermal conditions and full kinetic control. We adjust quantities of catalyst so that each reactor has the same number of active sites, $N_{S0} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}$ moles of active sites. This is important to consider for catalytic reactions because changing the total number of active sites in the reactor is akin to changing the extensive size of the system. We should be mindful of this change when trying to interpret differences in, e.g., time profiles for conversion and yield.  This is common practice in the field, but it is difficult to assign much significance to variation in conversion or yield at a specific time point unless the extensive size of the system (i.e., the number of active sites) is identical; this is rarely ensured in published batch experiments.\n",

In the first, one might clean the reactor, load it with a fresh charge of catalyst and reacting species, and perform the experiment a second time.  This would give us some idea of the level of reproducibility and precision we have each time we attempt to perform an indentical experiment, which is surprisingly difficult. Small variations in catalyst mass (it is hard to precisely measure out mg quantities of catalyst), temperature, and startup procedure can produce large variations in the data that we observe. We will not consider this type of replicate here.\n",

    "We observe nearly identical $C_A$ vs. $t$ profiles, suggesting that the catalyst structure and its active sites are not significantly altered (at least, not in a kinetically relevant way) over the course of the batch run. We can repeat the differential and/or integral analyses to estimate rate constants and barriers as usual, and we find little variation for this catalyst. This suggests that it is stable and that our initial active site count, $N_{S0}$, likely remains a good estimate for the active site density throughout the course of any one reaction and throughout all of our replicates."

    "We can see that the catalyst does not begin to behave reproducibly until the 7th or 8th replicate. Until that point, the catalyst appears to become less active with each run. This suggests that Ru/SiO2 undergoes some type of deactivation (sintering, coke deposition, poisoning, oxidation, etc.) upon exposure to reaction conditions. The tricky part is that this deactivation causes a time-dependent change in the \"extensive activity\" of the Ru catalyst (the number of sites participating in the reaction is probably decreasing, or each site is somehow becoming less active with time). It is impossible for us to resolve this deactivation from the regular time domain change in CA from a single experiment."
