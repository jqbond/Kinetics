    "## Example 02 - What Does Packed Bed Data Look Like?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our undergraduate coursework would have us believe that estimating reaction rates and inferring turnover frequencies from a differential packed bed is as simple as waiting for steady state and measuring the change in species flowrates across the reactor.  In this case study, we look at several typical types of startup profiles that we observe in catalytic packed bed reactors operating under differential conditions.  We then ask the question: what is the reaction rate, and what is our turnover frequency?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will stay with the example of the following gas-phase reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A + B \\longrightarrow C$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we test three catalysts at identical conditions of temperature, pressure, and composition--$\\mathrm{Pt/SiO_2}$, $\\mathrm{Ru/SiO_2}$, and $\\mathrm{PtSn/SiO_2}$. We perform ex situ site titration with $CO$ and $H_2$ chemisorption, and we have good estimates of the exposed metal site count on each sample. Accordingly, we prepare each packed bed so that it has 10 moles of exposed active sites at the start of the experiment. We then start the reactor and measure effluent concentrations using a gas chromatograph, and we use those to calculate effluent flowrate of our product, species C.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the graphs below, we plot the effluent flowrate of the reaction product, $F_C$, normalized by the quantity of active sites measured ex situ by chemisorption, $N_{S0}$. This is known as a \"site time yield.\"  In the limit of a true differential reactor without catalyst deactivation or restructuring, the steady state site time yield is equal to the turnover frequency of the reaction.  Data were obtained from an external simulation and stored in a .csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final note: the data here ***is simulated***; however, the simulations were tuned so that trends reflect those that we have observed in lab on these same catalysts during probe reactions like the hydrogenation of acetone or propanoic acid."

It can be very hard to tell from a single experiment, and, as ever, I would recommend a few things here:\n",

This means that not all of our sites have turned over yet, so it is hard to claim that the catalyst has reached steady state surface coverages and reaction rates.  A telltale sign of a reactor at steady state is that turnover number increases linearly with time on stream.

They are not exactly equivalent, as steady state is really determined by when the coverages of species participating in the RDS become time invariant, but the two should roughly agree.

Second, we see the system reaches a TON of 1 (all sites have turned over) by roughly 0.6 seconds. This suggests that the system should have reached steady state by ~ 0.5 - 1 seconds, but it hasn't. Finally, as we look at TON vs time at longer times on stream, we see that the TON is not linear in time. Rather, the slope of the line has begun to decrease (negative second derivative). This is a pretty clear indication that there is some loss of activity happening under reaction conditions, i.e., the catalyst is deactivating.\n",

I further note that this TON vs. time curve is not linear; rather, it has a positive second derivative, suggesting that the catalyst system is somehow become more active (induction) with time on stream. This could be due to restructuring, in situ changes in oxidation state, changes in dispersion, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This case is a bit more challenging because I have no good way to extrapolate the STY to zero time on stream and correlate activity with my ex situ quantification of active site density.  Here, I would have to use another option.  Two useful ones would be to:\n",

    "1. Perform post mortem chemisorption to get an understanding of the active site density at steady state (not under reaction conditions though)\n",

    "3. SSITKA type (transient) methods can sometimes be used to quantify the number of surface species, which can provide an estimate of the site number under reaction conditions. The challenge is that the system needs to be operating at very high coverage under reaction conditions and have infinitely fast mass transfer, otherwise, this is a difficult quantity to interpret.\n",

This post mortem characterization indicates that, at steady state, we have 375 moles of active sites inside the catalyst bed.  This is a substantial change from the 10 moles of active sites that we originally loaded into the bed.  We can normalize our steady state flow rate of product by this number and take it as an estimate of turnover frequency."

    "\n",
    "It is sometimes possible to add a strongly binding poison to the system. The purpose of this poison is to bind so strongly to the active sites that approaches a coverage of 1, occupies all sites, and renders the catalsyt inactive. By quantifying the amount of poison added to the system, one can determine the number of active sites under reaction conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first let the system reach steady state, and then we begin the flow of a titrant.  Some caveats:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The titrant flow should be small enough that it does not (over) titrate all active sites instantly. Rather, one wants to titrate sites over a discrete period of time during which both the effluent product flow and the titrant uptake can be monitored somehow.\n",
    "2. It is best to couple this method with an analytical technique that can monitor both titrant flow and product flow from the reactor effluent. In a flow process, it is unlikely that 100% of the titrant added to the reactor will always be taken up by the catalyst, so it is necessary to quantify titrant uptake and not only product flowrate.  GC methods are OK, but they are limited by the chromatography time scae (minutes). If possible, use things like UV, IR, MS, etc. which permit a continuous analysis of the effluent and some resolution of species based on spectroscopic signatures.\n",
    "3. It is difficult to find titrants that bind so strongly that they exclude all other adsorption under reaction conditions.  Some common choices might be CO for metals or pyridines for acid sites, but one should check to determine the validity of the 100% coverage assumption.\n",
    "4. One might imagine using something like H2S for metals, but be cautious when using extremely strong binding species as they may contaminate an apparatus and lead to problems down the road."
